## Overview 
Portable Parenting is a web application targeting parents who like to travel with their babies/toddlers while avoiding the struggles of carrying heavy luggages for their children. 

## Features
- View calendars with upcoming activities.
- Vote for favourite date and time for activities.
- Search for an activity.
- Add and remove other users to my friends list.

## Technologies Used
- **Ruby**
- **HTML**
- **SCSS**
- **Javascript**
- **Heroku**: For deploying the app online. 

## Usage
On the homepage, users will see a calendar with their upcoming activities if they have already voted for them. Otherwise, activities will be added to their calendars once all users will have voted for an activity. Users can search for a specific activity and click on this activity to see details (photo, description, location). They can also add and remove friends from their friends list.
