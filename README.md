On the homepage, users can see examples of some of the items available on the website. They can then search for a city and see which items are available. They can then click on a item to see more details about it. If they want to book the item, they can select the dates they want and send the booking request. The user renting the item can either decline or accept the rental proposal. The user will receive a notification of whether their booking has been accepted or declined.
